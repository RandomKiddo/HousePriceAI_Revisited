This project is adapted from a former project, [linked here](https://github.com/RandomKiddo/HousePriceAI), where Scikit-Learn was used on a house price dataset<sup>1</sup> to perform regression to predict the house price value.

I wish to revisit this project using Tensorflow instead of Scikit-Learn so I have more control over the AI itself. Additionally, the old model had an r^2 value of `0.999996824199374`, but that included house location data. I seek to create a model that does not rely on location data.
